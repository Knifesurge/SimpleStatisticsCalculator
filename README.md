# Simple Statistics Calculator

This is a super simple statistics calculator I made in Python 3.7.

## Features

Can calculate:
* Average
* Mean
* Standard Deviation
* Standard Deviation of the Mean
* Uncertainty in Average

You can also specify the number of data points you would like to enter instead of being trapped at some 
abitrary number (like N=10).
